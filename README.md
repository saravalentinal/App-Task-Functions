#App Task-Functions

This program lets you manage a list of tasks that may be pendant, in progress or finished. By entering the command "listar" you can list all your tasks and see each task state's. When entering the command "crear" followed by a new task name, you can create a new one on the list that will be assigned the "pendant" state. Finally, by entering the commmand "filtrar" you can filter all the tasks that are in a specific state that you should enter after the command.

If you run the app but don't enter any commands, the program will ask you to do so. If you enter a command that is not listed, the program will tell you it doesn't understand what you are trying to do.
